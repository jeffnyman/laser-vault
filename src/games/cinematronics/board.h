// board.h - the Cinematronics laserdisc game board (US version, Pioneer
// LD-V1000), which runs Dragon's Lair and Space Ace.
//
// The board is small: a Z80 CPU at 4 MHz, 40 KB of ROM space (most sets
// use 32 KB), 2 KB of RAM, an AY-3-8910 sound chip (which also reads
// the DIP switches), the joystick and buttons, a 16-digit score display, and
// an 8-bit parallel link to the laserdisc player. A timer interrupts the CPU
// about 30.5 times a second.
//
// The game's whole world is in its address space:
//
//     0000-9FFF  ROM
//     A000-A7FF  RAM (repeated through BFFF)
//     C000-DFFF  inputs: read from C000 + (sound chip, joystick, coins/
//                start and player strobes, laserdisc data) * 8
//     E000-FFFF  outputs: sound chip, misc latch, laserdisc data, score
//                display digits
//
// Details come from the schematics as documented in MAME's dlair.cpp.
