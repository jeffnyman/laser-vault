// autoplay.h - let the program play the game by itself.
//
// The game keeps the moves it's waiting for in a list in RAM (see
// autoplay.c). Each entry names an input, the windows of time when it
// counts, and an outcome code for each window, but nothing says which
// outcome is good. So whenever a new set of moves opens, the autoplayer
// tries each one on a copy of the machine, runs the copy ahead (much faster
// than real time), and keeps the move after which the hero doesn't lose a
// life. It only plays the joystick and sword; coins, start and Space Ace's
// skill level are up to you.
